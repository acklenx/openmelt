Driving:

Forward / Back are non-proportional
Left / Right is proportional
Throttle controls speed of rotation
Heading LED changes from solid to dashed at half-throttle
Best translation speed occurs at roughly half-throttle or below

Config Mode:

To enter or exit config mode hold the control stick towards the upper right for a few seconds while at zero throttle (the LED will start pulse-flashing).

Upon entering configuration mode the bot will note and store the "zero" value for the accelerometer (so - the bot should be roughly level).

Adjusting Tracking:
Move the throttle to about 25% - and the bot will start spinning.

The LED should be dashed (if it's not - lower the throttle position until it is).

Move the control stick left / right until tracking looks good (the LED will temporarily change to solid to confirm it's being adjusted).


Notes:
The current system assumes counter-clockwise bot rotation and that Ailerons (Left / Right) are set to reverse.

Config mode also allows for "heading" (which way is forward) adjustment - but it's confusing enough where we may just want to set this "in code."

Pulling the control sick back while throttle is at zero will cause the bot to flash out the max RPM from the last run

If the bot thinks it has a good RX link -and- Left / Right control is centered - it will flash the status LED quickly (if it's not - try adjusting the trim).

While trying to spin slowly - it can be easy to inadvertently go to zero throttle and think something has gone wrong.

If the bot stops for no reason - it may be a receiver issue (possibly from impact).  Powering down the transmitter for a second or two - then turning it back on may resolve.


-----------

Heading alignment:

Go into configmode

Go to full throttle

When moving forward calibration is off (normal drive test)

Steer left / right without going forward / back to adjust heading

	Moving the stick moves the LED beacon in the same direction
	
	

	2 seconds = about 90 degree rotation
